# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so a unit test will be written for every part of my code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Installation
Node.js, npm and Express.js must be installed to use this application.
